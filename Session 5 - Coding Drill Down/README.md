Target:

Get the set-up right

*   Set Transforms
*   Set Data Loader
*   Set Basic Working Code
*   Set Basic Training  & Test Loop

Results:

*   Parameters: 6.3M
*   Best Training Accuracy: 99.99
*   Best Test Accuracy: 99.24

Analysis:

*   Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem
*   Model is over-fitting, but we are changing our model in the next step
